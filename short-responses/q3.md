# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in a `controller` as the second argument.

What is a controller?

# Answer
The `controller` is a function that generates an response to its corresponding endpoint. When the client makes a request to an endpoint, Express invokes the controller than that goes with that particular endpoint as a response.
